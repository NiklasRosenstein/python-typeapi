The `typeapi` package provides a **unified and consistent** API for the reflection Python type hints from
CPython 3.6.3 onwards. It also allows evaluating string-literal type annotations of more recent Python releases in
older versions (such as [PEP585][] and [PEP604][] expressions).

To learn more about this package, visit its [documentation][].
